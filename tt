Below are the key topics I propose to cover during the session:

1️⃣ Spot the Phish – Helping employees identify phishing emails by observing signs and indicators like suspicious links, sender details, and urgent tone.
2️⃣ Safe Work Practices – Emphasizing that employees should avoid working from public places and that WFH should only be done with prior approval to maintain data security.
3️⃣ Device Access Policy – Reminding employees not to access or use another user’s device for any personal or work purpose to prevent data privacy and compliance issues.

My suggestion is as above — we’ll discuss these topics with all team members and get back to you with the finalized one.
